# Silent Error Handling in MATLAB's `arrayfun`
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to error handling in MATLAB's `arrayfun` function.  `arrayfun` applies a function to each element of an array, but it doesn't inherently halt execution if the applied function encounters an error.  This can lead to unexpected results without explicit error checks.

The `bug.m` file contains a function that throws an error for negative inputs. When this function is used with `arrayfun` on an array containing negative numbers, the errors are silently ignored and the corresponding outputs are not correct. The `bugSolution.m` file demonstrates how to properly handle errors in such a scenario, leading to more robust code.
